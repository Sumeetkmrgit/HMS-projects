<font size="+03"> Our Commitment to Quality, Safety, and Service—And Your Right to Know
As a Medical Center, no work is more important to us than earning the trust of our patients, their families, and the providers who refer them to us. That’s why our number one priority remains providing a safe, high-quality, patient- and family-centered care experience that combines the best scientific evidence, expert clinical judgment, and truly compassionate care.

Because of this, we’re devoted to continual improvement. And, while we’re understandably enthused by several areas in which we’ve recently shown remarkable progress, we won’t be content until our patient experience is among the best in the country. In fact, our leaders and our URMC Board of Directors challenge us to constantly review our performance and see ourselves as we truly are. This is the key to understanding what we are doing well – and where we still need to do better.
